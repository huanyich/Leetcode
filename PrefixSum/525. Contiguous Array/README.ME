Solution: Prefix Sum + HashMap
When dealing with subarrays, always consider utilizing prefix sums.
Since we are interested in the count of zeros and ones, we can employ a variable called 'count' to keep track of the difference between the number of zeros and ones. 
At each position 'i' in the array, we can check if there exists an array with the same value that we can subtract from the current subarray to achieve a difference of zero. 
To facilitate this process, we can utilize a hashmap to store the prefix sum of each position.
