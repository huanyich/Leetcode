Solution 1: brute force O(n^2)
Solution 2: prefix O(n)
    for each ith element, find it's left smaller or equal number's index
    for each ith element, find it's right smaller numbers
    
    first loop:
    use a monotonic stack
    pop out all ther larger numbers

    second loop: 
    use a monotonic stack
    pop out all the larget and equal numbers
