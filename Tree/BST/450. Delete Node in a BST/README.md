To delete a node in a binary search tree, we first need to locate the node with the target key. Once we find it, we need to consider the following cases:

If the node has no left child, we simply return its right child.

If the node has no right child, we simply return its left child.

If the node has both left and right children, we find its "successor", which is the node with the smallest key value in the right subtree. We then replace the key value of the node we want to delete with the key value of its successor. Finally, we recursively delete the successor node.

By following these steps, we can successfully delete a node from a binary search tree.
