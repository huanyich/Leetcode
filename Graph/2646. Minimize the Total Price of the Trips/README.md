Construct an adjacency list:
Construct an adjacency list to represent the graph. This will make it easy to traverse the graph and perform operations on each node.

Perform DFS to record frequency of passes:
For each trip, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph to record the frequency of times each node is passed. Since the graph is a tree, it will not have cycles, and there will be only one path from Node A to Node B.

Choose a starting node and use Dynamic Programming:
Choose an arbitrary starting node and perform Dynamic Programming (DP) to find the smallest possible sum. For each node in the graph, there are only two possible options: either halve it or not. Therefore, the problem can be reduced to finding the optimal solution for each subproblem, which can be done using DP.
