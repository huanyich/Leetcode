Intuition
To find the shortest path, always think of BFS.

Approach
Not as usual BFS, we may have to traverse the same node again and again, we use bitmask to record the state of visited nodes, if we visit a node that has the same state as before, we ignore it.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(m*n)
Space complexity:O(m*n)
